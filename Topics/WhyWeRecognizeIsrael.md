## Why do we need to recognize Israel as part of honoring God ?

When we speak of following God and honoring His people Israel, we are not inventing a command of our own. We stand on the foundation of God’s ancient covenant—spoken by His own mouth, recorded by His prophets, and preserved in His Word.

### **1. God Called Abraham and Set Him Apart**

When God first called Abram in Genesis 12, He did not simply give him a private blessing—He gave him a **mission** and formed a **covenant** that would shape nations:

> **“I will make of thee a great nation… and thou shalt be a blessing… and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”**
> — *Genesis 12:2–3*

And embedded in that promise is a principle for all generations:

> **“I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee.”**
> — *Genesis 12:3*

To bless the descendants of Abraham is not about politics, nations, or human preferences. It is aligning ourselves with God’s declared will.

### **2. God Reaffirmed His Covenant Over and Over**

The covenant was not a one-time moment. God confirmed it again:

* **To Abraham:**
  *“I will establish my covenant… for an everlasting covenant.”* (Gen. 17:7)

* **To Isaac:**
  *“I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father.”* (Gen. 26:3)

* **To Jacob:**
  *“The land… I will give it to thee, and to thy seed after thee.”* (Gen. 28:13)

Notice the pattern:
**God Himself guards the covenant. God Himself watches over Abraham’s seed.**

This is why following God includes respecting His chosen purpose for Israel.

### **3. God Commands His People to Walk in His Ways**

When Israel became a nation, the Lord made clear:

> **“Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people.”**
> — *Exodus 19:5*

Following God is not merely believing in His existence—it is obeying His voice.
And His voice has spoken concerning Israel, His chosen people:

> **“For the LORD’s portion is His people; Jacob is the lot of His inheritance.”**
> — *Deuteronomy 32:9*

If God treasures them, how can we despise what He treasures?

### **4. Blessing Israel Is Part of Fearing God**

The Psalms give us insight:

> **“Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.”**
> — *Psalm 122:6*

This is not about favoritism. This is about **alignment** with God’s heart and God’s promises.

When we bless what God blesses—He blesses us.
When we honor what God honors—He honors us.

### **5. God’s Faithfulness Is the Pattern for Our Obedience**

All through the Old Testament, God shows that **He keeps His promises**, even when His people fail. If God is faithful to His covenant, then those who fear Him should also respect that covenant.

Jeremiah writes:

> **“Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night… then may also my covenant with David my servant be broken.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:25–26*

God ties His faithfulness to creation itself.
So when we follow God, we stand with Him in what He upholds.

## **Conclusion of the Sermon**

We follow God because He is the Creator, the Lawgiver, the One who brought Israel out of Egypt, gave His covenant to Abraham, and rules over all the nations.

And we bless Israel not because they are perfect, but because **God chose them**, God made promises to them, and God blesses those who bless them.

To follow God is to honor His word.
To honor His word is to honor His covenant.
And His covenant begins with Abraham and his descendants.

---


## ** CONTINUES**

We have seen that God’s call to bless the descendants of Abraham is woven deeply into the covenant. But let us go further, and see how God Himself responds to nations and individuals according to how they treat His people.

### **6. God Judges Nations Based on Their Treatment of Israel**

In the book of the prophet Zechariah, the Lord gives a warning to all nations:

> **“For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye.”**
> — *Zechariah 2:8*

This is not poetry—it is divine reality.
To touch Israel with harm is to poke your finger into God’s own eye.
To bless them is to honor His heart.

Later, the Lord declares:

> **“I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.”**
> — *Zechariah 12:9*

This is why following God includes taking His side.
No nation that fights against God’s purpose can stand.
No people that bless His chosen will go unnoticed.

### **7. The Covenant Extends to Generations**

God told Abraham plainly:

> **“My covenant will I establish… for an everlasting covenant to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.”**
> — *Genesis 17:7*

*Everlasting* means it does not expire.

Even when Israel sinned, God never erased His promise:

> **“Yet for all that… I will not cast them away… to break my covenant with them.”**
> — *Leviticus 26:44–45*

His covenant becomes the model for us:
If God remains faithful, then those who follow Him should honor what He honors.

### **8. Following God Means Walking in His Commands**

The Lord commanded Israel:

> **“Hear, O Israel… thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart.”**
> — *Deuteronomy 6:4–5*

But He also commanded the nations around Israel to respect His chosen people.
Through Balaam, God spoke a truth that no sorcerer or king could undo:

> **“Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.”**
> — *Numbers 24:9*

God does not change His mind.
The principle remains.

### **9. God Uses Israel as a Living Testimony to the Nations**

Israel is not just a people—Israel is a message.

The Lord said to them:

> **“Ye are My witnesses, saith the LORD.”**
> — *Isaiah 43:10*

Through Israel:

* His power was shown in Egypt
* His holiness was shown in the Law
* His faithfulness was shown in the covenant
* His mercy was shown in their restoration
* His justice was shown in their discipline

To bless Israel is to bless God’s testimony on earth.

# **If Israel had sinned, why do we still recognize them?**


If we are to understand God’s heart toward Israel, we must listen carefully to the prophet Jeremiah. Jeremiah lived in a time of judgment—Jerusalem fell, the temple burned, the people were exiled. Yet in the midst of judgment, God revealed something deeper:
**His mercy is stronger than Israel’s failure.**

### **10. Israel’s Sin Was Great—But God’s Mercy Was Greater**

Jeremiah boldly declares Israel’s unfaithfulness:

> **“My people have committed two evils;
> they have forsaken Me… and hewed them out broken cisterns.”**
> — *Jeremiah 2:13*

Israel forsook the Lord.
They worshiped idols.
They broke the covenant again and again.

Yet even then, God’s heart was not to destroy but to restore.

### **11. God Calls Israel to Return Because He Is Their Father**

Listen to His invitation:

> **“Return, ye backsliding children, saith the LORD;
> for I am married unto you.”**
> — *Jeremiah 3:14*

God speaks like a husband calling back a wandering wife.
Like a Father reaching for a rebellious child.

Israel sinned deeply—but God’s commitment remained deeper still.

### **12. God Promises He Will Heal Their Rebellion**

Jeremiah presents one of the most tender promises in the Old Testament:

> **“Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.”**
> — *Jeremiah 3:22*

God does not say:
“I will consider forgiving you,”
nor
“I will watch you suffer for your sins.”

He says:
**“I will heal you.”**

Forgiveness is not merely God overlooking sin—
It is God restoring what sin broke.

### **13. God Promises a Day of Full Cleansing**

Even after the exile, God speaks through Jeremiah a promise of total forgiveness:

> **“For I will forgive their iniquity,
> and I will remember their sin no more.”**
> — *Jeremiah 31:34*

This is God speaking about Israel.
The same Israel that broke the covenant.
The same Israel that was scattered.

Yet God says:
**“I will remember their sin no more.”**

What nation has a God like this?

### **14. Israel’s Restoration Comes from God’s Faithful Love**

Jeremiah tells us the deepest reason for Israel’s forgiveness:

> **“Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love:
> therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.”**
> — *Jeremiah 31:3*

Everlasting love.
Not temporary.
Not dependent on performance.
Not canceled by rebellion.

This is why God forgives Israel:
**because His love is everlasting.**

### **15. God Will Not Reject Israel, Even After Judgment**

Even when Israel was in Babylon, God said through Jeremiah:

> **“I will not make a full end of thee.”**
> — *Jeremiah 46:28*

He disciplines—but He does not destroy.
He judges—but He does not abandon.

God’s covenant stands even when Israel stumbles.

### **16. God Promises to Restore Israel to Their Land**

Jeremiah records the Lord saying:

> **“I will bring again the captivity of My people Israel and Judah…
> and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers.”**
> — *Jeremiah 30:3*

Forgiveness is not only spiritual—it is national.
God restores the land, the people, and the covenant blessings.

### **17. God Turns Their Mourning Into Joy**

One of the most beautiful promises:

> **“I will turn their mourning into joy,
> and will comfort them… for I have mercy upon them.”**
> — *Jeremiah 31:13–14*

Israel may mourn for a season,
but God has decreed that joy will come.

## **CONTINUES: GOD’S EVERLASTING MERCY TOWARD ISRAEL**

We have heard Jeremiah speak of God’s unbreakable love and His promise to forgive Israel. But the message does not end there. The Lord expands this theme through the prophets, showing that His mercy toward Israel is not temporary—**it is woven into the very character of God.**

### **18. God’s Mercy Is Rooted in His Own Name**

Through Jeremiah, the Lord declares a powerful truth:

> **“For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee…
> Though I make a full end of all nations… yet will I not make a full end of thee.”**
> — *Jeremiah 30:11*

God ties Israel’s survival not to their obedience, but to **His own faithfulness**.
Nations rise and fall, kings come and go, but Israel endures because God’s name is on them.

### **19. The Covenant Cannot Be Broken**

Still in Jeremiah, the Lord gives an illustration that is impossible for men to change:

> **“If ye can break My covenant of the day, and My covenant of the night…
> then may also My covenant with David My servant be broken.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:20–21*

God says:
“If you can stop the sun from rising or the moon from shining—then My covenant with Israel can fail.”

Who among men can do such a thing?
No one.

Therefore, His covenant stands.

### **20. God Will Cleanse Israel and Restore Them**

Jeremiah records God’s promise:

> **“I will cleanse them from all their iniquity… and I will pardon all their iniquities.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:8*

Notice the repetition—“all… all…”
God does not forgive partially.
He cleanses thoroughly.

And then He adds:

> **“It shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:9*

Israel, once judged, becomes a testimony to God’s mercy before every nation on earth.

### **21. Israel’s Restoration Is Certain and Physical**

God does not forgive Israel only in spirit; He restores them **in the land**:

> **“Behold, I will gather them out of all countries…
> and I will bring them again unto this place.”**
> — *Jeremiah 32:37*

This is not symbolic.
This is not metaphorical.
This is God returning His people to the land He swore to Abraham.

### **22. God Promises to Plant Israel Permanently**

There is a promise rarely noticed, but it reveals the depth of God’s commitment:

> **“I will plant them in this land assuredly with My whole heart and with My whole soul.”**
> — *Jeremiah 32:41*

God Himself says He will plant them with:

* His whole heart
* His whole soul

What other nation has such a promise from the Creator?

### **23. God Will Give Israel a Renewed Heart**

Jeremiah explains that Israel’s restoration includes an inner transformation:

> **“I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear Me for ever.”**
> — *Jeremiah 32:39*

Israel will not only return to the land;
they will return to the Lord with a renewed heart.

### **24. God Turns Judgment Into Restoration**

Even the destruction of Jerusalem becomes a stage for God’s mercy:

> **“Again there shall be heard… the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:10–11*

Where there was once sorrow,
God decrees that joy will return.
Where there was ruin,
God commands restoration.

## **The Message Becomes Clear**

Jeremiah teaches us that:

* God forgives Israel
* God restores Israel
* God gathers Israel
* God plants Israel
* God transforms Israel
* God protects Israel
* God keeps His covenant with Israel forever

This is why we honor God’s people:
Because their story does not reveal Israel’s goodness—
**it reveals God’s goodness.**

It shows the world that:

* God keeps His word
* God does not abandon His promises
* God’s mercy is stronger than human failure
* God’s covenant stands through every generation

To bless Israel is to honor the God who forgives them.
To follow God is to respect what He has established.

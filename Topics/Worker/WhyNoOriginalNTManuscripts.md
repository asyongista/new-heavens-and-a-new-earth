**No original New Testament manuscripts (called *autographs*) survive today.**
What we have are **copies of copies**—some extremely early—and many Greek manuscripts, not just translations.

Here’s the clear breakdown:

---

## ✅ **1. Do we have the original writings?**

**No.**
All **autographs** (the exact parchment Paul, Luke, John, etc. wrote on) are lost.

This is normal—ancient documents written on papyrus rarely survive more than a few centuries.

## ✅ **2. So what do we have?**

We have **thousands of ancient manuscripts**, and they fall into categories:

### **A. Greek Manuscripts (the original language)**

The New Testament was written in **Koine Greek** (except maybe Matthew possibly using some Hebrew/Aramaic notes).

We have:

* **Papyri** (2nd–4th century) – earliest
* **Uncials** (4th–10th century) – written in capital letters
* **Minuscules** (9th–15th century) – cursive Greek
* **Lectionaries** – church reading books

These are not translations—they are **Greek copies** of earlier Greek texts.

Examples of oldest Greek manuscripts:

* **P52 (Rylands Fragment)** – Gospel of John 18
  Dates: **~125–150 AD** (earliest known NT fragment)
* **P46** – Pauline letters
  Dates: **~175–225 AD**
* **P66 & P75** – John & Luke
  Dates: **~175–225 AD**
* **Codex Vaticanus (B)** – nearly complete NT
  Dates: **~325 AD**
* **Codex Sinaiticus (ℵ)** – complete NT
  Dates: **~330–360 AD**

These are **not translations**, they are **early Greek copies**.

## ✅ **3. Do we have ancient translations also?**

Yes—very early:

* **Latin** versions (Old Latin, then Vulgate) – 2nd–4th century
* **Syriac** (Peshitta, Tatian’s Diatessaron) – 2nd century
* **Coptic** – 2nd–3rd century
* **Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic** – 4th–6th century

These translations help scholars reconstruct the earliest text.

---

## **Summary Answer**

* ❌ No original New Testament writings survive.
* ✅ We have **very early Greek copies**, some within decades of the originals.
* ✅ We also have early translations that help confirm the text.
* 📘 Modern Bibles are translated from reconstructed **Greek**, not from later translations.

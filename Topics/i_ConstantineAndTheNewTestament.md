The **New Testament books were not “discovered” at one single time**—they were **written in the 1st century**, **circulated**, and then **recognized (canonized)** over several centuries.
Here is the timeline clearly:

---

# 📘 **1. When the New Testament books were written**

All New Testament books were written between:

### **A.D. 45–95**

* Paul’s letters: **A.D. 48–67**
* Gospels:

  * Mark: **~A.D. 60–70**
  * Matthew: **~A.D. 70–85**
  * Luke: **~A.D. 70–90**
  * John: **~A.D. 90–95**
* Revelation: **~A.D. 95**

These books existed and were copied long before any “discovery.”

---

# 📜 **2. When the earliest manuscripts were found**

These are the **earliest physical copies** we currently have:

### **Oldest Fragment**

* **Rylands Papyrus (P52)**

  * Part of John 18
  * Dated **A.D. 120–150**
  * Discovered in **1920** in Egypt

### **Early Manuscripts**

* **Codex Sinaiticus** (almost complete NT)

  * ~A.D. 330–360
  * Discovered **1844–1859** at St. Catherine’s Monastery (Sinai)

  * Known to Vatican library for centuries, documented in **1475**

* **Codex Alexandrinus** (~A.D. 400–440)

  * Brought to England in **1627**

---

# 📖 **3. When the New Testament canon was finalized**

The **recognition of the 27 NT books** took time.

### **First complete list of the current New Testament**

* **Athanasius’ Easter Letter — A.D. 367**

He listed exactly **the same 27 books** we use today.

### **Councils that affirmed it**

(Not “decided” it, but confirmed what churches already used)

* **Council of Hippo (A.D. 393)**
* **Council of Carthage (A.D. 397 & 419)**

**Codex Sinaiticus** is one of the oldest and most important biblical manuscripts in the world.
It dates to **A.D. 330–360** and contains one of the earliest nearly complete copies of the **Christian Bible in Greek**.

Here is what it contains:

---

# 📘 **Content of Codex Sinaiticus**

## **1. Old Testament (Greek Septuagint) — Partially Preserved**

Much of the Old Testament (LXX) is included, but some books are missing or incomplete due to damage.

### **Books included (surviving parts):**

* Portions of **Genesis**, **Numbers**, **1 Chronicles**, **2 Esdras**
* Complete or nearly complete books such as:

  * **Psalms**
  * **Isaiah**
  * **Jeremiah**
  * **Lamentations**
  * **The Twelve Minor Prophets**
  * **Job**
  * **Proverbs**
  * **Ecclesiastes**
  * **Song of Songs**
  * **Wisdom of Solomon**
  * **Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)**

Many pages are lost, so some books are missing or incomplete.

---

# 📕 **2. New Testament — Almost Complete**

Codex Sinaiticus contains the **oldest complete New Testament** ever discovered.

### **All 27 books of the New Testament are present:**

* The four Gospels
* Acts
* Paul’s letters
* General epistles
* Revelation

A few small sections are damaged, but the entire NT is represented.

---

# 📜 **3. Additional Early Christian Books (not in the modern Bible)**

Codex Sinaiticus also includes two works considered important in early Christianity:

### **A. Epistle of Barnabas**

A 2nd-century Christian teaching text.

### **B. Shepherd of Hermas**

A popular early Christian allegorical work, widely read in the first centuries.

These books were respected by early Christians but not included in the final biblical canon.

If you want, I can also **make a visual timeline chart** so you can see all these events on a single line. It’s much easier to visualize. Do you want me to do that?
